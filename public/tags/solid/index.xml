      <title>SOLID - Dependency Inversion Principle</title>

      <description>The Dependency Inversion Principle emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; instead, details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple higher-level and lower-level modules.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Interface Segregation Principle</title>

      <description>The Interface Segregation Principle advocates that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, a class should not be forced to implement methods it does not need. Instead of a monolithic interface, classes should have smaller, specific interfaces tailored to their requirements.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Liskov Substitution Principle</title>
      <link>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-22-liskov-substitution-principle/</link>

      <description>The Liskov Substitution Principle defines that objects of a derived class should be substitutable for objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, any instance of a base class should be replaceable with an instance of a derived class without altering the desired properties of the program.</description>

      <title>SOLID - Open Closed Principle</title>
      <link>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-20-open-closed-principle/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-20-open-closed-principle/</guid>
      <description>The Open/Closed Principle emphasizes that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for **extension but closed for modification**. In simpler terms, the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code. This principle promotes the creation of a system that is both adaptable and sustainable over time.</description>

      <title>Single Responsibility Principle</title>
      <link>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-18-single-responsibility-principle/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-18-single-responsibility-principle/</guid>
      <description>At its core, SRP advocates that a class should have a **single reason to change**, meaning it should only have one responsibility. Essentially, a class should encapsulate one aspect of the functionality within the software. By adhering to this principle, the design becomes more modular, maintainable, and easier to extend.</description>

      <title>Mastering SOLID Principles in C#, Building Robust and Maintainable Applications</title>
      <link>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-15-mastering-solid-principles-in-csharp/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.sadin.dev/posts/2023-10-15-mastering-solid-principles-in-csharp/</guid>
      <description>SOLID is an acronym representing five essential design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin to guide software developers in writing maintainable and scalable code. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design, focusing on enhancing the maintainability, extensibility, and reusability of the codebase.</description>
